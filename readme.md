add, search, and view products with details such as name, type, price, and tax. The app **uses
modern
Android development practices, including MVVM architecture,Retrofit for rest api calls, LiveData,
ViewModel, koin for DI, splash
API for splash screen, jetpack navigation components, and WorkManager for background tasks**.
